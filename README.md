# Python-Port-Scanner-with-PHP
This script was created with knowledge from the previous script. In this Script we will look at how to run this script in a PHP file.

Three files will be used.
1. A PHP File that will display the information 
2. A PHP file that will run at the background and called using jQuery.
3. The Python script that will perform the port scanning activity.

#Implementation
You will have to fill in a form and submit only the address of the link that you want to scan.
On a mouse click the next php file will be called through jQuery and this file will then call the python script to proces the user input.

This script was tested with Python 3.4 and found to working very well.
